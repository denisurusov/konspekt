# Concept: Not a memory layer

konspekt is not agent or platform memory (Mem0, Zep, Claude Projects, ChatGPT,
Gemini Gems). Those are machine-authored, machine-read: a model decides what is
salient, extracts a compressed version, and stores it to feed back to a model —
the reader is the agent. konspekt inverts both terms: human-authored,
human-read, incidentally machine-readable. So the user is a human working on a
project, not an agent needing recall.

Three differentiators — curation, provenance, openness. You curate; the model
only proposes (propose→accept), so the guarantee is *integrity, not
completeness*: what is in the record is there because you put it, verbatim and
linked to its source text. And it is a public format, not a product — readable,
diffable, portable, with no service to run and nothing to lock into.

The layers compose rather than collide: a konspekt instance is a clean,
human-validated source you can feed *into* a memory or RAG pipeline. konspekt is
upstream of memory systems, not a competitor — which dissolves the "clash" worry
directly.
