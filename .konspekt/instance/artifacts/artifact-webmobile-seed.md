# Artifact: web/mobile seed instruction

The slot-equivalent of the `AGENTS.md` stanza, for conversations that live on
web/mobile rather than in a repo working tree. A compact pointer-instruction the
human pastes once into a platform context slot (Claude Project, custom GPT,
Gemini Gem): it names the backend repo, tells the conversation to read the
skills, data model, `OPERATING.md`, and live instance, then operate the
propose→accept→persist loop via the GitHub connector. A pointer, not a payload —
the knowledge stays in the repo. Lives at `setup/WEBMOBILE_SEED.md`; documented
in `setup/README.md` alongside `init.mjs`.
