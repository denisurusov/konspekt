# Artifact: Conformance checker

R8. Reads an instance directory and checks it against `spec/data-model/schema.ts`
and `spec/architecture/SERIALIZATION.md`. Zero dependencies, never throws on a
broken instance, pure — no clock, no network, no git subprocess.

Neutral by placement: `lib/` belongs to neither `setup/` nor `visual/`; both
import it and neither imports the other. It was previously embedded in the
visualizer's snapshot build, where an adopter never saw it.

`lib/validate.mjs` is the CLI over it. `visual/build/snapshot.mjs` is the other
consumer. The `conformance` component installs both files into an adopter's repo
as projections.

Checks beyond the visualizer's original subset: edge kind and domain/range,
entity enums and the noteworthy status vocabularies, required fields, fields the
schema does not define, duplicate edge ids, weight outside `relates`, and the
provenance verify probe — `sources/<sourceRef>.md` must exist and its git blob
SHA must equal `contentHash`. The blob SHA is recomputed arithmetically rather
than shelled out, so verification works on a directory that is not a repository,
which is the condition the manual re-upload probe exercises.
