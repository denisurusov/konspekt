# Artifact: technical whitepaper

A non-normative, second-implementer-depth technical summary of konspekt at the
repository root (`WHITEPAPER.md`). Covers motivation and stance, the data model
(entities, edge kinds, derived views, human vocabulary), the four architecture
contracts (reconciliation, serialization, transport, review), the operating
loop, adoption (setup kit, web/mobile seed, distribution), and status. It routes
every section to the owning file under `spec/` as authority and states that
`spec/` governs on any conflict, so it summarizes rather than competing as a
second source of truth. Excluded from `distribution/` by intent — see
`nw-whitepaper-non-normative`.
