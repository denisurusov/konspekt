# Waypoint: Introduce the engineer persona layer

Introduce the engineer persona as the first konspekt specification layer over
the persona-agnostic core. The layer contributes ASR (a Concept `subtype: asr`)
and ADR (a Waypoint `subtype: adr` on `kind: decision`), content-addressed
executed-command provenance (`commands/<contentHash>.md`), and the `drives`
and `executed` edge kinds. Core gains only generic hooks — an optional
`subtype`, provenance-ref edge endpoints, and a `personas` activation list —
so it carries no engineer vocabulary. The decision statement is this body; its
forces are the inbound `drives` edge from the layering ASR, and its
consequences are the `spec/personas/` pages, the `schema.ts`/`SERIALIZATION.md`
hooks, and the checker's registry-merge path. Recording this decision as an ADR
is the engineer layer's own first use.
