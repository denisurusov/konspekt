# Noteworthy: Distribution is derived, not copied

Outward-facing artifacts (`distribution/`) are a regenerable projection of the
repo root, baked by `distribution/build/distribute.mjs` — not a hand-maintained
copy. A tracking copy of `spec/` would be two sources of truth that drift: the
same dual-authority problem that `reference/` became, one layer out. Root stays
the single source of truth; the projection is stamped with its source commit and
never hand-edited. Frozen `--version` builds are how a release pins, so an
adopter resolves to a spec that does not move under them.
