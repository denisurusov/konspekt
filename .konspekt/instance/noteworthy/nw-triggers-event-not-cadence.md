# Noteworthy: Operating-loop fires on events, not a cadence

The loop fires on two events, not a clock or turn/session rhythm: (1) the LLM
maintainer ventures a proposal when it judges an atom has crystallized
(propose / `sync`, always `review: proposed`), and (2) a human manual command
accepts and persists (`sync` / `persist` / `sync_persist` plus the authority
verbs — human authority carries acceptance). Per-turn was excluded as noise;
end-of-session was rejected because "session" has no portable meaning across LLM
vendors. Readiness is LLM-judged against the node types — workable but explicitly
imperfect — so it needs a readiness bar that holds until something settles, or it
decays back into per-turn noise.
