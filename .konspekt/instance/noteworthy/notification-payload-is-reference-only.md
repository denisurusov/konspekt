# Noteworthy: notification payloads carry references, not content

A notification carries entity `id`, type, the event, a link to the commit, and a
link to the source excerpt under `sources/`. It does not carry entity body text.

The reason is an access asymmetry. Repo watchers hold repo access by definition;
an address in `notify.yml` holds whatever the payload hands it. On a private
instance, anyone who can land a change to that file can subscribe an address they
control and begin receiving project content without ever holding repo access —
the config file becomes an exfiltration path. Reference-only payloads close it:
reading anything substantive requires following a link and authenticating.

The sources link resolves correctly for entities born accepted, where
construction and acceptance are the same act. Where an entity's state later
changes, the fired verb must write a new source excerpt for that exchange and
`provenance` must be repointed at it, so provenance always justifies the current
state. Entities predating the content-addressing discipline carry only a
`conversationId` and need a fallback.
