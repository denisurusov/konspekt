# Concept: Content-addressed provenance

Anchoring an entity's origin to the *content* of its source text — a pointer
plus a matching digest — rather than to a host-issued identifier. The text is
something every binding can produce; the id is not. Makes edits self-evident
(new content → new hash) and dedup structural.
