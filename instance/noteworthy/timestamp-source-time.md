# Noteworthy: timestamp is source time, never transport time

`provenance.timestamp` records when the source exchange *happened* and is
binding-independent. The timeline must never be derived from transport metadata
— e.g. a git commit time — even though the store knows it. Commit time is when a
write landed (transport), not when a thing was said (source); reading it would
give the dumb blob store a semantic job the contract denies it, and would break
on any binding without commits. Source time stays a first-class field carried by
the data.
